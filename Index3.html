      <p>Dry cat food contains between six and ten percent water, combined with other ingredients. These ingredients include: meat, poultry, 
        grain, fish, milk, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Due to the dryness, dry food is not as tasty and palatable to cats when compared to wet and mixed food. 
        Flavor enhancers, such as animal fat, is used to make it more tasty. Dry cat food is considered inexpensive when compared to the other options because
        it does not dry out, which allows it to be stored for longer. However, dry cat food needs to be kept in a cool and dry area, or else it would go rancid. Storing it
        for too long would end up losing the potency of vitamins, fats, and flavors.</p>

        opened, the food will dry out and become inedible or rancid.</p>
