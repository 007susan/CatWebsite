    <p id="diet-paragraph">Dry food contains between six and 10 percent water. Depending on the specific formulation, a mixture of
      ingredients are combined, extruded, and dried into bite-sized pieces. Ingredients may include:

      meat and/or meat byproducts
      poultry and/or poultry byproducts
      grain and/or grain byproducts
      fish meal
      fiber sources
      milk products
      vitamin and mineral supplements.

      The pieces of dry food are often then coated with flavor enhancers, such as animal fat, to make the food more
      appetizing.

      Dry cat food is relatively inexpensive, and since it does not dry out, it offers owners the convenience of “free
      choice” feeding. However, dry food may be less palatable to a cat than moist or semi-moist food, and depending on
      the types and quality of the ingredients, may also be less digestible. If you do use dry food, it is important to
      store unused portions in a cool, dry location, and not to use the food after its expiration date. Owners often buy
      large amounts of dry food that can sometimes be stored for months, so checking the expiration date before feeding
      it to your cat is very important. Storing food for a long period of time decreases the activity and potency of
      many vitamins and increases the likelihood that fats will become rancid. It’s a good idea to store dry cat food in
      an airtight container to help prevent nutrient deterioration and maintain flavor.

      Semi-Moist Food
      Meat and meat byproducts are the primary ingredients of semi-moist food, which contains approximately 35 percent
      moisture. Other materials, including soybean meal, cereals, grain byproducts, and preservatives are added to make
      the final product. The cost of semi-moist food is generally mid-range. Semi-moist foods may be more appealing than
      dry cat food to some cats and can also be fed free choice. After the package is opened, however, the food can dry
      out, becoming less palatable and/or becoming rancid.

      Canned cat food has a moisture content of at least 75 percent, making it a good dietary source of water. It is
      generally the most expensive type of cat food, but is also highly palatable for most cats. Many different
      varieties are available, which can be helpful if your cat is a finicky eater. Canned food has the longest shelf
      life when unopened, but any unused portion of opened canned cat food should be refrigerated to maintain quality
      and prevent spoilage. Gourmet canned cat foods generally feature meats, such as kidney or liver, and whole meat
      byproducts as primary ingredients. Some brands, however, may be nutritionally incomplete, and it is important to
      read the nutrition labels carefully on such specialty cat-food items to ensure that they have a nutritional
      guarantee.
