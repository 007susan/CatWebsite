## **Overview**
This was a website created with HTML5, CSS properties + flexbox, and Bootstrap.

## **My process**
It was an interesting and fun experience to combine Bootstrap with CSS. In this project, I learned to override and customize some Bootstrap classes with custom CSS styling. I also experimented with responsive design. 

## **Continued development**
Later into this project, I learned about BEM as a naming convention for CSS. Currently I use this order: -, __, and --. Although I was told by a friend that naming is personal preference, I would like to use BEM (block, element, modifier) more in the future.
